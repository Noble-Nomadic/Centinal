# Centinal
C based sentinal is a simple CLI system for managing a files, tracking device peformance, encrytion, and a simple anti-virus.
This is a fun project for an old linux laptop.

More features may be implemented over time, but I am casually working on this in my free time so I don't want to commit to a bunch of features now.
